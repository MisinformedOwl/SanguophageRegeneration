	<!-- Standard tick rate is 12000, this is enough to regenerate a few limbs if i remember 
	correctly and was what i found to be the most appropriate setting as it largely recovered 
	most injuries over the course of the death rest 

	On 12000 it takes ~45% of the deathrest time to fully regenerate a limb like a leg. This is approximatly 40 hours of deathresting.
	Do with this information what you will.
